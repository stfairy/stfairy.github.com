{"body":"### Background\r\n\r\n**Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System**, or **Nachos**, is instructional software for teaching undergraduate, and potentially graduate level operating systems courses. It was developed at the University of California, Berkeley, designed by Thomas Anderson, and is used by numerous schools.\r\n\r\n### Nachos in SJTU\r\n\r\nThis course project was adopted by [ACM Class](http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/) in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), and after some years of development, we had our own [Nachos framework distribution in Java](https://github.com/stfairy/nachos-framework) since 2009.\r\n\r\n### As my course project\r\n\r\nI finished this course project in my third undergraduate year, and was required to build it from scratch and individually, including the major pieces of a modern operating system: (more details [here](http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/cs376/fa11))\r\n\r\n* Phase 1: Build a thread system\r\n* Phase 2: Multiprogramming\r\n* Phase 3: Caching and Virtual Memory\r\n* Phase 4: Networks and Distributed System (discarded)\r\n* Phase 5: File System\r\n\r\nAt the end of the semester, I earned the [**full score**](#) in this course, and ranked 1 out of 31 students in our class.\r\n\r\n### Authors and contributors\r\n\r\nThis course project is required to be done individually, so I completed all the pieces of Nachos by myself.\r\n\r\nThe Nachos framework was originally adopted from [this course](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa10/Nachos/index.html) and almost rewritten by teaching assistants from ACM Class.","tagline":"Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System","note":"Don't delete this file!
