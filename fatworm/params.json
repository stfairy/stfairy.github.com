Students are required to work in teams to design and implement a complete database system from scratch, with support of a subset of SQL and JDBC. Query execution and optimization is encouraged as advanced topic. Student programs will be graded by an auto-grading system against various test-cases.\r\n\r\n### As my course project\r\nI was in a team with my classmates [Shijian Li](http://www.lishijian.com/) and [Liuli Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/liulichencs/) for this course project, and wrote several components of the system as follows.\r\n\r\n1. Write a SQL parser in ANTLR v3\r\n2. Add JDBC support\r\n3. Design the interfaces between different phases\r\n4. Write the storage backend, including a buffer manager and an on-disk B+ tree implementation\r\n5. Write a low-level access layer like [SQLJet](http://sqljet.com/), which allows one to manipulate and query records with keys and indexes directly _(we employ this special design in order to work in parallel, since query plans can be naively translated to operations provided by this low-level access layer)_","note":"Don't delete this file!
