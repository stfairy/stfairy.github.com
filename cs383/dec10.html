Test result download: <a href="2013.12.10.20.48.51.tar.gz">2013.12.10.20.48.51.tar.gz</a>
</p>
<p>
Please make sure your submitted JAR file can be executed as follows:<pre><code>java -cp your.jar:java-cup-11a-runtime.jar -jar your.jar program.spl</code></pre>
and output *exactly* the result defined in the specification.
</p>
<p>
For example, for the attached test file <a href="factorial.spl">factorial.spl</a>, your program should output exactly <tt>24</tt>,
WITHOUT any other information.  Your program CANNOT read from any other file (e.g. DO NOT READ FROM doc/... and so on).
Make your program behave like a real compiler/interpreter.
</p>
<p>
Please resubmit to xjia@cs.sjtu.edu.cn before December 15th.  No further resubmission will be allowed.
If I cannot run your program after this resubmission, your score for the project will be ZERO.
Pay attention to this, and ask your friends for help about how to export a correct JAR file.
